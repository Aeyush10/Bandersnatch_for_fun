# Bandersnatch_for_fun
A CUI Turbo C++ game complete with a central story and minigames
There are 2 modes to play: Admin and Player. The Leaderboard part involves data handling and as expected is very flaky, so I don't encourage trying to figure that out.
Player takes you through a story and is quite fun as based on your answers (yes or no) there are many possibilities to explore.
Admin lets you try out all the minigames for yourself without the story: that's quite fun too, and if you're just looking for intelligent logic then use that mode for sure.
And yes, the name is Bandersnatch because I was inspired to make a choose-your-own-adventure video game because of the black mirror episode. Sue me. Actually, don't.
PS, the game involves sound so make sure to keep your sound on.
For file handling related issues use the for Apple version.
